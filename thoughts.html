      <h2>Some Initial Thoughts</h2>
      <p>I find that there is a great deal I have left to learn and I am just trying to learn more. I have been lucky enough to attend Cornell where I have learned a great deal. I participated in the Co-op program my Junior year working for Sentrana, Inc. in Washington, DC as a software engineer. working as a co-op made me realize just how much I had learned at school and how much I still had to learn about how software is made as a product. I had a great mentor at Sentrana who despite some inauspicious beginnings now laughs at me just as much but has still taught me a great deal about programming. You can code projects for classes as much as you want but nothing will teach you about services and stack traces as much as being confronted with a 10,000 line code base whose main contributor has left the firm. </p>
      <p>There was also the hipster systems engineer and sassy scientific computing specialist who left their respective marks filling in large gaps that my classroom education had left. My mother once gave me a book called an <strong>An Incomplete Education</strong>. I feel like this could be a description for my computer science experience to this point.</p>
